 # Project health data ETL 
 This project has been produced to ingest a healthcare_data set that I located on kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset. 
 
This dataset is free to use and has a public license attached. The data has been created using python and the Faker library.  I have taken the csv data and manipulated further, such as replacing age for DOB, introducing a POSTCODE for now.
